# Game Night Selector

This application is designed to allow a group to automatically select the first game to play on game night.​

The application will filter and select the game based on:
   - Number of players
   - Available games
   - Players game type preference
   - Age restrictions

# How will it work?

1) The Graphical User Interface (GUI) will ask the user to select names from a pre-populated list.​

2) When the player's names have been selected the user will click "Choose Game".​

3) The Program will filter available games and randomly select one.​

4)  The selected game will appear on a new pop-up.​

5) If the group wants a different game, or they want to change the players, they can close the selection window and click "Choose Game" again or alter player selection prior to choosing a new game.
